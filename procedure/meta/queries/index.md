# Some handy [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) queries

Given [accurate maps of procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#maps) and enough instance data of things subject to those procedures, we can start to treat precedence as a thing we can query for.

This is a list of SPARQL queries used by the House of Commons Library to check and report on their work. Feedback and requests always welcome. Please email [RIIDMSMailbox@parliament.uk](mailto:RIIDMSMailbox@parliament.uk).
