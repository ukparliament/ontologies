# Specific flavours of Statutory Instruments

Some Statutory Instruments, mostly those under the affirmative procedure, differ slightly from the main procedure. Differences are usually set out in the enabling legislation that the instrument is laid under. We've tried to distinguish these types of instruments where possible. 

## Affirmative instruments laid under Paragraph 14(6) of Schedule 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018

[Paragraph 14 of Schedule 8 of the EU Withdrawal Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/8) sets out an enhanced procedure whereby a published draft of an instrument must be published 28 days on Gov.uk before the instrument is laid before Parliament. Under 14(6) there is an allowance for Government to bypass this procedure fby reason of urgency and lay an instrument. They have agreed to provide a written statement to Parliament setting out why they have bypassed the procedure. We are in the process of adding [Published drafts](https://trello.com/b/6Tv4O13K/published-drafts) to Parliament's Statutory Instrument Service. In the meantime, you can find statutory instruments that have bypassed that procedure under Paragragh 14(6) below:

## Made affirmative instruments under paragraph 5(3) of Schedule 7 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988

Made affirmative instruments made under [paragraph 5(3) of Schedule 7 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/41/schedule/7) are laid before the House of Commons only and do not follow the usual approval period of the made affirmative procedure. Instead the approval period end date is determined by the Local Government Finance (England) report being approved by the House of Commons or before 1st March (the deadline for local authority budgets), whichever is earlier. The made affirmative instrument sets out the non-domestic rates for the next financial year. It is made and approved before the report is published and remains law if the report is approved. If the House of Commons does not approve the report the instrument stops being law, likewise if the report is not published/approved by 1st March then the instrument lapses and, again, stops being law. 

The following query looks for any such instrument:

## Made affirmative instruments under Section 55(3) in conjunction with Section 56(5) of the Sanctions and Anti-money Laundering Act 2018

Made affirmative instruments made under Section 55(3) in conjunction with Section 56(5) of the [Sanctions and Anti-money Laundering Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13) do not follow the usual approval period of the made affirmative procedure. Instead these instruments are subject to an approval period of 60 days beginning with the first day on which any provision of the regulations come into force. The provisions of the instruments come into force when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office make commencement orders. These made affirmative instruments cannot be debated and approved until a commencement order is made.  There has already been one [commencement order made in March 2019](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/627/made) which applied to seven made affirmative instruments. A second commencement order is due to be made in December 2020 which should apply to any outstanding made affirmative instruments.

## Statutory Instruments introducing one or more criminal offences 

The [European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/body) requires statements of the "good reasons" for the creation of and penalties for any criminal offences under the key powers in the Act. In April 2018 [Baroness Goldie made the committment](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2018-04-25/debates/A9F4CE42-D434-4DC4-8DAE-799A1265BB8A/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Bill#contribution-164583F6-E06F-41D0-B0D2-D85FECECC501) that these statements would be made available to Parliament before the SI which creates a criminal offence is laid.

## Affirmative instruments under the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020

Affirmative instruments laid under various sections of the [United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/27) are subject to the Minister seeking legislative consent from the devolved authorities. While the process of seeking legislative consent is off stage of Parliament it is possible to identify such instruments to mark them out as different. 

If the Minister does not seek consent from one or more of the devolved authorities they must make a statement to Parliament explaining why consent was not sought.

## Made affirmative instruments under Section 25 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996

Made affirmative instruments laid under [section 25 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/25) allow a Minister to make and lay an instrument, but under [section 77](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/77) of the same Act, the instrument will have effect only after a resolution has been passed by both Houses approving it. The instrument is laid without a number but once approved by both Houses it is reregistered with a number. This results in there being two records for the same instrument on legislation.gov.uk - one with a number, one without.

## Instruments referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee

The [Social Security Advisory Committee](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/social-security-advisory-committee) is an independent statutory body that provides impartial advice on social security and related matters. Under Section 172 of the [Social Security Administration Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/5), where the Secretary of State proposes to make regulations under any of the relevant enactments of the Act, they shall refer the proposals to the Committee. Under section 174 of the Act, the Committee shall make a report containing recommendations with regard to the proposals. The Secretary of State will also make a statement in response to the Committee's report. The report and statement are laid as one paper before Parliament alongside any regulations. Note that the Social Security Advisory Committee are only referred instruments on occasion, it does not happen every time the Department for Work and Pensions lays an instrument.

## Instruments that require a Government Actuary report

The [Government's Actuary](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-actuarys-department) provides actuarial advice and support to the government and public sector. Under sections 142, 150(8), 150A(5) and 151A(6) of the [Social Security Administration Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/5), the Government Actuary will provide a report that sets out their opinion on the effect on the National Insurance Fund of the proposed uprating of contributory benefits as set out in draft orders laid before Parliament by the Department of Work and Pensions. These orders are usually laid on an annual basis alongside draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating Orders and draft Social Security (Contributions) (Rates, Limits and Thresholds Amendments and National Insurance Funds Payments) Regulations. Though, sometimes the report will explain the determination by the Government not to lay the latter order. More information on the National Insurance Fund can be found [here](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn00797/). [National Insurance Fund accounts](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-fund-accounts) can be found on gov.uk.

## Made negative instruments laid under Section 22(2)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013

As set out under Section [22(2)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/25/section/22), the Department of Health and Social Care will provide a report that set out the reasons for changing the amount that members contribute to the NHS Pension Scheme or the desirability of not making any changes at this point in time.
