# Committee consideration of statutory instruments

All statutory instruments subject to the modelled procedures must be considered by at least one of the following committees:

* [Statutory Instrument Select Committee (SCSI)](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/149/statutory-instruments-select-committee) - considers all instruments that are laid in the House of Commons only (usually instruments related to financial and tax matters)

* [Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments (JCSI)](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/148/statutory-instruments-joint-committee/) - considers all instruments laid before both Houses

* [Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee (SLSC)](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/255/secondary-legislation-scrutiny-committee/) - considers all instruments laid before both Houses 

* [Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR)](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/93/human-rights-joint-committee/) - considers all remedial orders laid before both Houses

* [Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/173/delegated-powers-and-regulatory-reform-committee/) - considers all legislative reform orders laid before the House of Lords

* [Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-committee/) - considers all legislative reform orders laid before the House of Commons

* [Regulatory Reform Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/131/regulatory-reform) - considered all legislative reform orders laid before the House of Commons until 2021. 

## All instruments

The following queries will show all instruments considered by the committees and their outcome. There is also a sub query that shows all instruments that should have been considered or are due to be considered by the committee. The Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee aims to consider all bicameral instruments within three weeks of laying (not including recesses) while the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments/Select Committee on Statutory Instruments aim to consider all instruments within five weeks of laying (not including recesses). Affirmative instruments tend to take priority.

## Instruments laid before Commons only or bicameral

The following queries separate SIs laid before the House of Commons only and those laid before both Houses (bicameral). The bicameral query is of the most interest as these instruments are considered by two committees so the query shows the outcomes of both side by side. The SCSI is responsible for considering House of Commons only SIs but in the 2017-19 session there were a few occasions when the JCSI considered instead:

## JCSI / SCSI reasons for reporting instruments to the House(s)

The following queries show the grounds for drawing attention to an instrument by the JCSI or SCSI. While the reasons the committees may raise concerns are set out in the standing orders of both Houses, the committee generally focuses on the five reasons detailed in the Commons [sessional returns](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/csession/202122/return.html#heading-6).  Instruments can be reported for multiple reasons and for the same reason in multiple respects. In the queries below, we've mentioned the Standing Order in both Houses that the reason applies to.

## Scrutiny reserve for JCSI or JCHR suspended

The following query looks for all the occasions that House of Lords Standing Order No 72 was dispensed with. This allows a motion to approve an affirmative instrument laid before the House to be moved on that day whether or not the Joint Commmittee on Statutory Instruments or, if a remedial order, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has reported on it. As of March 2022 the JCHR reserve had not been dispensed with.
