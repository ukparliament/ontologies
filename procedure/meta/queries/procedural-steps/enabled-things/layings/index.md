# Enabled things by laying body

Enabled things will be laid before Parliament by a laying body, or in the case of published drafts under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 Parliament a notification will be laid. The duty of a body to lay papers before a House is imposed by an Act of Parliament. 

The following queries provide a list of all statutory instruments subject to the four main SI procedures, proposed negative statutory instruments and published drafts laid before Parliament by laying body. The data in these queries goes back to the beginning of the 2017-19 session. 

Queries have also been provided for Machinery of Government changes where Departments were merged, split and created (where they take on new responsibilities from another Department).
