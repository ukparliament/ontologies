First the statutory instrument had to be published in draft for 28 days to allow for comment. Second, when the instrument was formally laid, the Minister was required to make a scrutiny statement setting out the Government response to any recommendations made by a parliamentary committee on the draft, and any other representations on the instrument. The instrument laid did need not be identical to the published draft, if it made amendments as a result of that consultation. Only 20 instruments used the procedure and it was abolished by sec 10 (1) of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023.","12"
