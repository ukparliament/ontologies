1,iWugpxMn,Made affirmative,Instruments subject to the made affirmative procedure are signed into law before being laid in Parliament but require approval from Parliament within a specified period. There are different types of made affirmative SIs: the most common type of made affirmative SI comes into force before it is approved (and can come into force before it is laid) but cannot remain in force unless it is approved by Parliament within a specified period.  Another rarer type of made affirmative SI is laid after being made but cannot come into force unless the instrument is approved by Parliament. The relevant procedure and the length of the approval period is defined in the parent Act.,3,1948-01-01 00:00:00+00,,sunleyj@parliament.uk,2025-06-18 10:14:14+01,"3, 1, 2"
2,iCdMN1MW,Proposed negative statutory instrument,"A Minister may exercise powers under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 to propose that instruments be subject to the proposed negative procedure. After a proposed negative instrument has been laid, each House has ten sitting days in which it may consider the instrument and agree with the proposal of the Minister, or instead recommend the instrument be subject to the draft affirmative procedure. In the Commons, the instrument is considered by the European Statutory Instruments Committee. In the Lords, the instrument is considered by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. Any result of consideration does not bind a Minister, who must nevertheless make a written statement if disagreeing with a recommendation of a committee.",6,2018-06-26 01:00:00+01,,sunleyj@parliament.uk,2025-06-18 10:18:22+01,4

10,jaKY87jt,Published draft under European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Repealed),"Paragraphs 13-15 of Schedule 8 to the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018 set up a  a two-stage affirmative procedure for any instruments to amend or revoke secondary legislation originally made under the European Communities Act 1972 (most Directives were implemented that way). First the statutory instrument had to be published in draft for 28 days to allow for comment. Second, when the instrument was formally laid, the Minister was required to make a ""scrutiny statement"" setting out the Government response to any recommendations made by a parliamentary committee on the draft, and any other representations on the instrument. The instrument laid did need not be identical to the published draft, if it made amendments as a result of that consultation. Only 20 instruments used the procedure and it was abolished by sec 10 (1) of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023.",12,2018-06-26 01:00:00+01,2023-06-29 01:00:00+01,sunleyj@parliament.uk,2025-01-16 09:12:03+00,2

42,OvnVdtXG,Proposed draft remedial order,"Remedial orders are a type of statutory instrument. Under the Human Rights Act 1998, courts can declare Acts of Parliament incompatible with the European convention on human rights. The Government can use remedial orders to amend Acts to remove the incompatibility.  A minister formally presents (or ?lays?) a proposal for a draft remedial order. Parliament has 60 days to consider the proposal. The Joint Committee on Human Rights (a Committee of Members of the Commons and Lords) also scrutinises the proposal.  At the end of the 60-day period, the minister can lay a draft remedial order. The minister has to report details of any representations made during the 60 days and any changes made to the proposal.",8,2000-10-02 01:00:00+01,,sunleyj@parliament.uk,2025-06-18 10:47:09+01,1
