# Handling debates

If a neutral motion is debated - a motion that does not result in a decision being taken - we specialise the Chamber debate step.

If a motion is meta - where its primary topic is not the work packageable thing but a request to tweak the implementation of the procedure - we specialise the Chamber debate step.

If the motion's primary topic is the workpackageable thing but it does not require the House to come to a view, we do not specialise the Chamber debate step.

# Handling withdrawals at the end of debates

Motions requiring a decision by the House may be debated and then withdrawn before the question is put.

Question first raised on email by Anya in May 2018.

This came up again in April 2019. It was decided that additional routes, from the debate step to the step for withdrawal of the motion, make sense if the 'flowcharts' are read as flowcharts. But once inside the machine, the flowcharts are really state diagrams. Withdrawal of a motion is not precluded until decision steps are actualised. Although additional routes would make the flowcharts easier for people to follow, they do not add anything from a machine processing point of view. Decision not to add additional routes was agreed between Anya, Jayne, Robert and Michael.

# Preclusions between things that can happen in multiple and things that can't

Anything that can happen multiple times cannot preclude something that happens a single time. This means that, for example, a motion to refer to DLC - of which there may be multiple over time / sessions, cannot preclude the DLC debate because this can and does only happen once.
