There are occasions on which two business items actualising two different steps happen in the same work package on the same day: this class determines the display depth of those two business items. Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it is not possible to order business items in a way that makes 'procedural sense', for example: we may show 'procedure concluded' before an instrument has been approved. Step display depth exists in order to allow a number to be associated with a step in a procedure allowing us to order by the date of the business item, then by the display depth of the step in the procedure. Display depth in this context is not absolute across the procedure. A step with depth 8 may happen before a step with depth 7. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening."@en ;

A procedure may have one or more concluding steps. A step collection named 'Website visible steps' collects steps which are intended to be visible on a website work package page once actualised by a business item in that work package. A procedure may have one or more steps described as website visible. A step collection named 'Second reading', within the House of Commons, collects steps forming that stage in that House.
