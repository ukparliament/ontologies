Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it was not possible to order business items in a way that made 'procedural sense', for example: we may have shown 'Procedure concluded' before 'Instrument approved'. This class records the display depth of a business step forming part of the procedure, associating a display depth number with each step. For example: the 'Instrument created' business step in the draft affirmative procedure has a display depth of 1.0, whereas the 'Laid before the House of Commons' business step in the same procedure has a display depth of 3.1. These numbers are used to order business items in a work package sharing the same date. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening. A business step with depth 8.0 may happen before a business step with depth 7.0, if those two business steps are on different branches of the procedure map. A business step may have different step display depths in different procedures."@en ;
