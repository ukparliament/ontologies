ppr:Procedure rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Procedure"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A procedure in a House or Houses. For example, the passage of a made affirmative statutory instrument in both Houses. A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure. Procedures may be constructed from commonly occurring sets of routes. For example, the set of routes involved in EVEL certification."@en ;

ppr:Route rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Route"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A route is a link from one step to another. The source of a route may also be its destination. A route is available when the from step is True, actualised by a business item having a date in the past, or by the input from a logic gate step being True. The validity period of a route may be indicated by its start or end date. A route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised indicates that actualisation of the step will happen in the future, being a causal relationship."@en ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://parliament.uk/ontologies/procedure/> .

ppr:Step rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Step"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A step is either a business step, a logic gate step or a decision step. Steps are joined by routes to form procedures. For example, within the SI procedures there exists a step named 'English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) consideration'. Steps may occur in more than one procedure. For example, all statutory instrument procedures include the EVEL consideration step."@en ;

ppr:LogicGateStep rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf ppr:Step ;
	rdfs:label "Logic gate step"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A logic gate step performs a logical operation on one or more routes. Both the input and the output of a logic gate are either True or False. A route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised by means of a logic gate step with type NOT indicates that actualisation of the step cannot happen in the future, being a precluding relationship. A step may preclude itself from repeated actualisations by means of a set of routes through a logic gate step of type NOT to itself. For example, in the made affirmative statutory instrument procedure the step 'cleared by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments' may happen only once, being a precluding relationship."@en ;

ppr:LogicGateType rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Logic gate type"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A logic gate has a type of NOT, AND or OR. A logic gate with type NOT when given True has the result False and when given False has the result True. A logic gate with type AND takes at least two routes as inputs: if all are True the output route is True. A logic gate with type OR takes at least two routes as inputs: if at least one is True the output route is True."@en ;

ppr:DecisionStep rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf ppr:Step ;
	rdfs:label "Decision step"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A decision step describes the requirement for a decision to be made before the to route can be followed. Routes may be indicated as allowed rather than causal by means of a decision step. A route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised by means of a decision step indicates that actualisation of the step may happen in the future, being an allowed relationship."@en ;
