#######  Classes ##### 	

pfb:FormalBody rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "FormalBody"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A group of people with a specific remit engaging in the formal business of Parliament. Usually these are committees or committee-like bodies established by Parliament. Sometimes formally constituted by Parliamentary procedure (e.g. via Standing Orders), sometimes constituted on a less formal basis (e.g. the Lord Speaker's Advisory Panel on Works of Art). Some formal bodies are established outside Parliament but still have a formal link to Parliament (e.g. the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament). Some formal bodies are established under statute. Formal bodies usually consist of a subset of Members of Parliament from the House of Commons, or peers from the House of Lords, or a mix of both appointed to deal with particular areas or issues. Occasionally a House meets as a Committee of the Whole House allowing all members of the House to attend and participate. Formal body membership generally reflects the political makeup of the House. All Party Parliamentary Groups are informal groupings of members with no formal place in the legislature so do not fit within this category."@en ;

pfb:ParliamentaryCommittee rdf:type owl:Class ;

pfb:SelectCommittee rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf pfb:ParliamentaryCommittee ;
	rdfs:label "SelectCommittee"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "Select Committees work in both Houses. They check and report on areas ranging from the work of government departments to economic affairs. The results of these inquiries are public and many require a response from the government. House of Commons Select Committees are largely concerned with examining the work of government departments. Select Committees in the House of Lords concentrate on broader themes rather than individual departments."@en ;

pfb:GeneralCommittee rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf pfb:ParliamentaryCommittee ;
	rdfs:label "GeneralCommittee"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "The main role of General Committees is to consider proposed legislation in detail. This committee system allows faster processing of bills and is unique to the House of Commons; the Lords meet as a whole House in this function. There are various types of General Committee: Committees on Bills, Grand Committees looking at matters specific to the devolved nations of the UK, and General Committees on delegated legislation and European documents."@en ;

pfb:NonSelectCommittee rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf pfb:ParliamentaryCommittee ;
	rdfs:label "NonSelectCommittee"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "The House of Lords does not have General Committees but does have non-Select Committees. At a Select Committee of the House of Lords, Peers are not excluded from attending and speaking but they must not attend any meeting while the Committee deliberate, unless invited by the Committee to do so, and they must not vote. At a non-Select Committee, any Peer can attend, speak and vote."@en ;

pfb:FocusCategory rdf:type owl:Class ;
	rdfs:label "FocusCategory"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "The type of thing a Formal Body concentrates on. Whereas Focus might point to a specific item of legislation, the Focus Category would say that this Formal Body was constituted to scrutinise a specific item of legislation but not identify which one. Options for this are: a specific item of legislation, a type of legislation, one or more government departments, matters specific to devolved nations etc."@en ;

	rdfs:label "WorkPackage"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "A grouping of activities performed by a Formal Body potentially including meetings, calls for evidence, evidence sessions, publications etc. Work packages (including inquiries) are not a type of process. Formal bodies have roughly the same powers and undertake roughly the same activities but different formal bodies can choose to work differently.
