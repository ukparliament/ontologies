	rdfs:comment "Parliamentary questions (often referred to as PQs) allow Members to seek information from an answering body or to press a Secretary of State to take a particular action. Usually this is to a Minister in a government department but sometimes questions can be asked of non-departmental bodies. e.g. Church Commissioners. Parliamentary questions can be asked in expectation of either a written or an oral answer (one spoken by a Member in the Chamber). Unlike urgent and private notice questions, which are applied for to the Speaker or Lord Speaker privately, parliamentary questions are tabled with the Lords or Commons Table Offices."@en ;

Sometimes round robins are used as a way for a Member to intentionally ask the same question of multiple answering bodies. Occasionally they're used where departmental responsibility for a given policy area is not clearly defined. Note that the definition of a round robin is fuzzy; the question text might vary slightly. Identifying round robins is a judgement call."@en ;

Sometimes a question in pursuit of an oral answer will be scheduled to be asked in the Chamber, but the Member intending to ask the question will be unable to attend the Chamber at that time. At this point the Member may either withdraw the question or unstar it (remove it from the schedule), meaning the question will receive a written answer. Sometimes a question may be scheduled in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. Unless the Member subsequently indicates that they wish to withdraw the question, a written answer will be given. In either scenario, such questions would have two Answer Expected As relationships: one for the initial period when the form of answer expected is oral and one for the second period when the form of answer expected is written. Note that the rules regarding unstarred and unreached questions only apply in the House of Commons. In oral question time in the House of Lords, a Member may ask a question on behalf of another Member."@en ;

In other words, a group of questions tabled by a single Member in receipt of the same answer. There is some debate as to whether the same text given in answer to questions from multiple Members can be considered one, or the same, answer. This also allows a single question to have many answers. Sometimes there will be multiple answers from a single answering body at different points in time (holding answer, substantive answer, corrected substantive answer). Sometimes different answers from different answering bodies to the same question e.g. answers to a round robin question. Note that this is a major change to current data models, where a single question can have one and only one answer, and a single answer can be to one and only one question."@en ;
