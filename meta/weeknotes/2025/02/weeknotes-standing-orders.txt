## Orders being standing

As is well-known, our [standing orders application](https://api.parliament.uk/standing-orders) was well on the way to production when it entered uncharted waters and foundered on rocks. The rocks in question being lack of paragraph numbers, lack of hypertext links between orders, and lack of markup for tables. I mean, who puts tables in standing orders? Absolute madness. Anyway. [Shedcode](https://shedcode.co.uk/) [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies) solved the first problem some time back. This week, he also solved the other two. Look. See. [Actual tables](https://so-test.shedcode.co.uk/revision-sets/151#order-130). Lovely. Thanks James. Let's see what we trip over next.
