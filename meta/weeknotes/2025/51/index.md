# 2025 - Week 51

Here we go then. Week [51](https://www.factoryrecords.org/factory-records/fac-51-hacienda.php), Haçienda that then, as [Michael](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasticlife.bsky.social) assures us they say up north. As yet another calendar makes its way to the recycle bin, it's time to sit back and take stock. Consider this our end of year review show, except with Joana Lumley replaced by Librarians and our mid-table computational experts taking on the Peter Kay duties.

## Some hits, some misses

Our brand, spanking new Open Data Platform ends the year much as it started, being somewhat bereft of data beyond the odd testing spike. Which is obviously less than ideal. In better news, we really - honestly - think we're getting close. This Friday saw all hands on deck as Jianhan's [Single Triple Store Solution](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2025/49/#you-wait-all-year-)&trade; got a reasonably good, load test-type kicking. Which, happily, it seemed to survive. Jianhan notes that having the server doing the [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST)ing and the server on the receiving end of the POSTing located in two different bits of Europe probably isn't helping with performance. Still, it's better than when Michael accidentally set up our [search service](https://parliamentary-search-265cced0397e.herokuapp.com/) - a service that relies on a couple of APIs located in South East England - somewhere in the US of A. Well. I think we've all been there.

Sticking with the search service, the departure of Developer Jon back in March saw work grind to a juddering halt. Public sector recruitment never being easy, this was not a gap we could readily fill. [Young Robert](https://bsky.app/profile/robert-brook.com) and Michael tried their best - god love 'em - making a stumbling attempt to wrap Jon's efforts in the [parliamentary design system](https://github.com/ukparliament/design-assets/tree/main/library_design). But then Bootstrap's grid system met Jon's grid system and the whole thing fell apart in their hands.

In better news, our production Search and Indexing [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) finally saw the upgrade it deserves, our Jianhan once more wielding his computational spanner in expert fashion. Librarians one and all expressing delight at its new and improved response times, no longer finding themselves with time to knit a jumper in the gap between request and response.

Also on the upgrade pile is our taxonomy management system, which sits at the centre of a truly tangled web of applications and application piping. Once again, Jianhan was making magnificent progress, [five of the thirteen applications that sit atop that system being reconfigured to play nicely with its reshaped APIs](https://trello.com/b/R7GDcGou/semaphore-56). That was until [data.parliament.uk](https://explore.data.parliament.uk/) developed a fire in the hold and Jianhan was sent in with a fire bucket and our very best wishes.

We should probably do a section on data.parliament.uk, though it remains, in a very real sense, something of a mystery to us. Least said, soonest mended, as it were.

Getting back to our taxonomy, it's finally had the opportunity to stretch its legs a little and now provides the backbone for our Single Subject View of the Library project and Library Knowledge Base application. Librarians Anna, Susannah, Silver, [Phil](https://bsky.app/profile/philbgorman.bsky.social) and Ned combining like Voltron into a truly terrific little team.

Librarian Jayne and computational 'expert' Michael have had noses to the grindstone, attempting to upgrade our Procedure Editor application to a [Data Graphs](https://datagraphs.com/)-based replacement. At our last planning day, they had suggested getting the data in would be done by Christmas, testing to commence in the new year. Which Christmas was not specified, but it certainly wasn't this one. Nevertheless, they assure us [they are close](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/editor/data-graphs/instance-data/data-loading). One last shove perhaps. Maybe two.

Whilst Procedure Editor may still have a long and winding road to replacement, its output found a new home in our shiny new [Procedure Browsable Space](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser)&trade;, which went from random thought to whiteboard to breaking ground to almost ready for the limelight in a little under ten months. A design grand enough to bring a smile to even Kevin McCloud's lips. Despite choosing to 'project manage the build ourselves', we're pleased to add that Librarian Jayne did not find herself living in a leaking caravan for any of that period. No work marriages were harmed.

Thanks to the paperwork performance efforts of [Boss 'Brarian Bryn](https://bsky.app/profile/brynmrgn.com) and [Delivery Manager Lydia](https://bsky.app/profile/lydiakeegal.bsky.social), our use of [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) hosted on [Heroku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku) has now been declared legal by the Enterprise Architecture Council. Which comes as something of a relief, given our [psephological efforts](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/) have been running there since early 2024. Taking that down would have been somewhat embarrassing for all concerned.

Sticking with election results, Librarian Anna has been beavering away in the background, tidying data for [by-elections in Parliaments 56](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/parliament-periods/56#by-elections), [57](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/parliament-periods/57#by-elections) and [58](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/parliament-periods/58#by-elections) into the sort of shape that would not shock a computer. Once by-elections for Parliament 55 are in there, we will finally be at general election / by-election parity. But that's one for early next year. Not to be outdone, Data Scientist Louie chipped in with [notional results for the 2005 general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/7). Another brick in the psephological wall.

With almost nothing to show for his efforts - at least not yet - Michael's also been dipping the occasional toe in waters psephological, all in preparation for the next general election. His paddling much improved when Data Analyst Rachel offered up her SQL skills and helped nix a table or two. Deleting things always nice.

Somewhat surprisingly, we appear to have become the leading exponents of the parliamentary design system, Shedcode James having packaged it into a Ruby Gem which has now been rolled out across [11 of our 15 Rails applications](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PoPVTDi8vTzXTaCWLgaz3Axg92derrM0lM0AqZDazaI/edit?usp=sharing). And much improved they look too. Unless HTML brutalism is more your style.

In personnel if not personal news, Librarian Claire sadly left us, [Librarian Emily](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyjdavi.bsky.social) gained a promotion and Librarian Harry with be joining us in the new year. Our computational 'experts' remained unchanged and resolutely un-promoted.

## Bullet points from the last week

* Three models emerged freshly repainted from the pixel shop in the form of our [procedure ontology](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology), [procedure step annotation ontology](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure-step-annotation/procedure-step-annotation-ontology) and [delegation ontology](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/delegation/delegation-ontology). Recommended if your Christmas reading pile is short on gripping thrillers.

* A whole slew of improvements have been made to our Library Knowledge Base / Subject Specialist Finder&trade; from data model, to data integration, to website presentation.

* [Shedcode](https://shedcode.co.uk/) [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/deck/@jamesjefferies) leant a helping hand with our Procedure Browsable Space&trade;, meaning it no longer explodes when ["smart" quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_marks_in_English#Smart_quotes) make their way down Whitehall, into Westminster, travelling through assorted computational pipes before meeting a web browser that's been told - quite reasonably - to expect [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

* Our Procedure Browsable Space has also gained a whole host of CSV download options, all of which await sign off - or indeed rejection - from Librarian Jayne. Do get in touch if you think we've missed any. Not content with that, Michael has also applied [rel-canonicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element) from resources that transclude to the resources being transcluded from. Well, it seems to make him happy, and we don't like to ask.

* Shedcode James has also applied the wisdom of Solomon to our standing orders application, which is now cleaved in two. One for our crack team of librarians to edit things in, [one for more general consumption](https://api.parliament.uk/standing-orders/). Not that Solomon cleaved anything in two of course. We [Scripture-knowledge sharks](https://www.pagebypagebooks.com/P_G_Wodehouse/Right_Ho_Jeeves/Chapter_17_p10.html) stick together.

* Our much commented upon [treaty procedure map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/treaties/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf) - a print out of which would make fine wrapping paper for the procedural librarian in your life - has gained two new steps used to describe a report being laid under [section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/21/section/42). Steps that appears have been [actualised](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e508) across four treaties, if the [House of Commons incarnation](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/steps/ExqXeUcx) is to be believed. Which, obviously, it is. We are professionals you know. 

* Librarian Emma has combed through [23 years worth of estimates proceeding records](https://trello.com/c/xqEmdgHe/202-estimates-proceedings-and-relating-records), linking each and every one to any recommendation of the [Liaison Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/103/liaison-committee-commons) concerning areas for debate, business motion for said recommendations where moved in the Chamber and any formal proceedings to approve the estimates following the debates. All of which, our dear reader will be able to see, once Jon gets back and fixes our beta search service. Providing we have some data in the Open Data Platform of course.

And with all that out of the way, it only remains to wish our dear, dear reader a very merry Christmas and the best of fortunes for the new year. May your data points always reconcile, your URIs dereference and your computational pipes never experience blockages.
