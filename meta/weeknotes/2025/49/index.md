# 2025 - Week 49

## Yeah, yeah, facilitated workshops (to the tune of [Industrial Estate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ViEzjcc6sE))

As the factory whistle blew and the weekend kicked in, everybody's favourite team of crack librarians and computational 'experts' found themselves coming down off the back of a week's worth of workshops. Or so it felt.

The first such workshop was a sparsely attended affair, only Data Analyst Rachel, Data Scientist Louie and mid-table computational 'expert' [Michael](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasticlife.bsky.social) deigning to attend. In fairness, they were the only people invited. If we're forced to be honest, it was really more of a meeting than a workshop. Still, options were discussed and drawn up, so let's try to agree it was a workshop. That works better for narrative consistency.

At this point, our dear reader is probably wondering why they met and what problem they were 'workshopping'. Well, there is a certain bit of software left over from the reign of [Data Scientist Oli](https://bsky.app/profile/olihawkins.com) used to manage information on and around a general election. It will probably come as little surprise to our dear reader that, by the time of the [last general election](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/6), that application had already left the home for aged software and entered the palliative care stage, poor Louie having to nurse it through its final moments. Clearly the software needs replacing, or future general elections will prove tricky. Now we already have a candidate - excuse the pun - data model for all things election related in our [election results schema](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/meta/schema). What we did not have was a data model describing the workflow in the lead up to a general election, on election night itself, and during the days and weeks that follow. As a result of that meeting / workshop, [we do now](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/election/meta/candidates/admin.svg). In the first instance, it's all a bit fag-packety, but, come the new year, we hope to decorate a whiteboard or two, set up a test instance of [Data Graphs](https://datagraphs.com/), throw some data at it, and see what breaks. Fun.

The second workshop of the week was also general election preparation related, assorted colleagues from the Library and the [Parliamentary Computational Section](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/parliamentary-digital-service/) meeting to discuss a way forward. From the Library side, [Anya](https://bsky.app/profile/anyaso.bsky.social) was there, Louie was there, [Bryn](https://bsky.app/profile/brynmrgn.com) was there. From the Computational Section, Natalie was in attendance, Tom was in attendance, [Mr Korris](https://bsky.app/profile/mattkorris.bsky.social) was in attendance. From the liminal zone between Library and computers, Rachel and Michael also showed their faces. And Ben was there. Though why general elections should be of interest to the red carpet contingent remains a mystery. The whole event was powered by a Tupperware full of '[tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_(confectionery))' that had turned up courtesy of a kindly librarian in Edinburgh and somehow found its way through parliamentary postal security without being exploded. Thanks [Librarian Jaf](https://bsky.app/profile/jaffne.bsky.social). Lovely stuff. It certainly added a dash of sugar to proceedings.

The final workshop of the week was a little more diverse in nature, seeing colleagues from the [Scottish Parliament](https://www.parliament.scot/), [Senedd Cymru](https://senedd.wales/), [Northern Ireland Assembly](https://www.niassembly.gov.uk/), and the [Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office) descend upon Tothill Street for a day full of adventures in the hinterlands of the [Sewel Convention](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8883/) in general and [Legislative Consent Motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_consent_motion) in particular. For those unfamiliar, the Sewel Convention is a UK constitutional principle whereby the UK Government agrees to 'not normally' legislate on devolved matters. 'Not normally' doing quite a bit of heavy lifting there.

Whenever the UK Government presents a public bill to the UK Parliament, the explanatory notes indicate which parts of the bill the minister believes engage devolved matters. Devolved legislatures might give the green light for Westminster to legislate - “grant consent” - or raise concerns / objections about devolved law being changed in this way. Such concerns - or indeed lack of concerns - are signified by the medium of Legislative Consent Motions, these being debated and resolved in the devolved legislatures. In all of this, time is of the upmost importance, devolved legislatures needing to get their proceedings underway in a timely fashion.

For the past few years, officials in all four legislatures - and indeed all four executives - have been attempting to keep track of where and when consent has been given or withheld. This job made more difficult by the four legislatures sharing [collaboration tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365) whose definition of the c-word stops at the boundaries of an organisation. Collaborative working not made any easier when you're forced to email round copies of spreadsheets. Thanks Microsoft.

Librarian Jayne and computational midfield journeyman Michael were both in attendance, being called to the stage late afternoon to give a quick run through of the [statutory instrument service](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/), the [treaty tracker](https://treaties.parliament.uk/), the [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology) that sits behind them, and the [procedural maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/) that underpin them. Maps we've made with colleagues from the devolved legislatures setting out [their](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/devolved-legislature-consent/northern-ireland-assembly/northern-ireland-assembly-consent.pdf) [LCM](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/devolved-legislature-consent/scottish-parliament/scottish-parliament-consent.pdf) [procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/primary/public-bills/components/devolved-legislature-consent/senedd-cymru/senedd-cymru-consent.pdf) in a [computable fashion](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/meta/design-notes/#parsing-work-packages-subject-to-a-procedure) were shown. Always a treat when a parliamentary clerk sees one of their procedures as a computer might see it.

Finally, Librarian Jayne demoed her first stumbling attempts at LCM data collection via the medium of our new-ish and still somewhat shiny [Procedure Browsable Space](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser)&trade;. The collection of such data not helped by the four legislatures involved being in possession of a set of websites that are fragmented at best. And all fragmented in a slightly different fashion. It wasn't like their were gasps, or even applause, but those assembled did seem suitably impressed. Why not [take a look](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packages/primary-legislation). Let us know which bits you find useful. And which bits less useful. Given just a little more librarian time and a little more developer time, it's something we'd love to continue working on. Thanks for the invite [Graeme](https://bsky.app/profile/woodstockjag.bsky.social).

## You wait all year ...

... for a means to populate a triplestore, then two come along at once.

For the past few months, developers in the wider Data and Search team have been struggling over how one might populate a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) sitting on an external Azure subscription with data from a different triplestore running inside the parliamentary network. The first attempt at synching the two stores was not as successful as we'd hoped it might have been, our motto of 'no triple left behind' falling slightly short. Tech Lead Andrew has taken a slightly different approach, writing new code in the shape of the Replicator. Whether this route is any more successful remains a matter for conjecture. 

Meanwhile, our Jianhan is taking a different approach, coming to the conclusion that two triplestores is one too many and instead updating all the things that currently [POST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)) to the internal triplestore to POST to the external triplestore instead. As of this week, he's [created a new resource group](https://trello.com/c/LVUi4WNS/1-create-a-new-resource-group) in the external subscription and [installed a new triplestore](https://trello.com/c/xsb938lA/5-install-new-triplestore-in-new-resource-group) in that resource group. He's also pointed the [software responsible for ingesting material from line of business systems](https://trello.com/c/4NhaZQWj/10-point-thresher-at-new-triplestore-via-cloudflare-etc), the [indexing application used by our crack team of librarians to subject index that material](https://trello.com/c/4KNRI5rT/12-point-indexing-application-at-new-triplestore-via-cloudflare-etc), the [indexing service](https://trello.com/c/JuWJKxiq/36-point-indexing-service-at-new-triplestore-via-cloudflare-etc), and the [software responsible for keeping our taxonomy in sync](https://trello.com/c/8h8GBfKp/11-point-orefis-at-new-triplestore-via-cloudflare-etc) at that new triplestore. All of this behind Azure Application Gateway and Azure API Management, with Cloudflare protection to follow shortly. Jianhan has even managed to [expose a SPARQL endpoint for the new triplestore](https://trello.com/c/u7yQyx7E/20-set-up-new-sparql-endpoint-in-new-resource-group), [create Workbench accounts](https://trello.com/c/35EcdWnB/43-workbench-accounts-for-anya-and-rachel) for both Anya and Rachel, and write up a [roll out and roll back plan](https://trello.com/c/d4TVusZW/45-go-live-and-rollback-plan). A frankly amazing amount of work, in little over a week. There's a reason we keep paying the lad.

Given we now have two potential solutions to the triplestore replication problem, the next job is to work out which one's best. Data Analyst Rachel is currently working with Librarian Anya and computational super-sub [Young Robert](https://bsky.app/profile/robert-brook.com) to put together a test plan for the two options. We're told Westminster bookies are now placing bets.

## Psephologising wildly

In news [psephological](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/), the final table of denormalised data - [depicting party performances in a boundary set across general elections](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/6/parties) - has now been removed. Albeit in a non too elegant fashion. Michael continues to work with ['SQL neurotic' Rachel](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/humans.txt) to add a layer of professionalism over the top of his [ham-fisted efforts](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/blob/main/app/controllers/boundary_set_general_election_party_controller.rb). As with previous denormalised data removal - [weeknotes passim](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2025/43/) - this means that, when the next general election rolls round, we'll be able to load data in a much more timely fashion. Which we're hoping will please both elders and betters.

Last out, we reported [a new approach to the general election publication cycle](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2025/47/#psephologising-wildly), the data building over time, instead of landing in one big dump at the exact moment the rest of the world has lost interest. As a half-formed part of the plan, we're hoping to expand our proposed four-stage solution, to a 4.5 stage solution, whereby constituency elections with verified results show the full suite of numbers, whilst those awaiting verification continue to show winners only. A new database has been compiled, the code adapted slightly and the final .5 stage is now available on a test server. Which we can't point you at for fear of confusing Google et al. So you'll just have to [take our word for it](https://trello.com/c/JCUZENjE/584-45-state-solution).

## Managing Members

Our slightly depleted Member information management team have managed to [tick off one more task](https://trello.com/c/1gT4Bh1k/463-shunt-uk-births-into-england-wales-scotland-and-northern-ireland), all Members - current and past - of the House of Commons who had had their place of birth marked as UK, have now been informationally shunted into England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland buckets as appropriate. There remain a handful of 'ghost profiles' still assigned to the UK, but that is more a problem with ghost profiles than their place of birth.

In even better news, team:[MNIS](https://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/#) will not be depleted for too much longer, recent recruitment concluding successfully. Better still, it turns out our new recruit was coming to the end of his contract elsewhere in the Library, meaning he'll be able to join us on the far side of Christmas. Both Librarians Anna and [Phil](https://bsky.app/profile/philbgorman.bsky.social) looking somewhat less frazzled as a result.

## On the timing of procedural eggs

A minor update to our [beloved Egg Timer](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer)&trade; came about off the back of a degree of confusion on the part of Librarian Ned. Why, asked Librarian Ned, did the November recesses show up in [calendar views](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer/calendar/2025/11) as a recess in the House of Commons, but not in the House of Lords? The full explanation is really rather long, so we shan't bore you with it here. Needless to say, it all came back - as so many Egg Timer&trade; related matters do - to the usual chestnut of "no account [being] taken of any time during which [both / either] Houses are adjourned for more than four days".

Now if we had our way, we'd say four days off is little more than a long weekend, and that the word recess should only come into play when we're talking five days or more. But it is not our job to tell the House of Lords what is a recess and what is not. Anyway, that wee foobar is now considered fixed.

## Taxonomic tidying

When parliamentary material arrives on the desks of our crack team of librarians, it is neither interlinked nor fully described. A second reading reported in Hansard, for example, does not know it was a second reading, which bill it was a second reading on, or what subjects were discussed. The job of a librarian is to take this rough hewn stone and polish it to a diamond-like gleam. Subject indexing is applied by means of a spot of subject analysis and annotation with terms from our taxonomy.

For those more familiar with taxonomies represented in [SKOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System), the next bit may prove surprising. Our taxonomic tooling does not - yet - use SKOS, but rather a system called [Zthes](https://zthes.z3950.org/). In all major senses, the two systems are similar, but subtle differences exist. And we all know what happens when subtle differences meet computers.

Unlike SKOS, non-preferred terms in Zthes are identified things. And, over the years, some of those identifiers have made their way into our triplestore as subject indexings. Now the plan, as our dear reader will well know, is to upgrade our taxonomy management software - two major versions behind what is current and no longer supported by the vendor - and the upgraded version will be SKOS-based. Which left us with a problem whereby some parliamentary material would be subject indexed with identifiers for things that no longer exist. Or do exist, but only as strings, not identified things.

Taking the bit between his teeth, Librarian Ned roped in Data Engineer Victoria and our Jianhan and set off on [a tidying mission](https://trello.com/c/hh4UL5Z5/395-non-preferred-terms-used-in-triplestore). As of this week, Ned reported we now have exactly zero uses of SES IDs corresponding to a non-preferred term. Excellent work all round.

## Outreach / engagment

Finding themselves with an hour to spare, Anya, Jayne and Michael popped online to watch a short seminar on the subject of [Principles for a Digital Legislative Process: Translating Procedure into Digital](https://events.bussola-tech.co/translating-procedure-digital). A subject rather close to their hearts. The seminar was hosted by [Bússola Tech](https://www.bussola-tech.co/), and, what could have been some god-awful vendor-centric horrorshow, was instead a thoughtful tour of the current state of the art. If someone male dominated. The [video of the session is now online](https://video.bussola-tech.co/p/principles-for-a-digital-legislative-process-translating-procedure-into-digital). If you're at all involved with parliamentary procedure refracted through the prism of computers, it's well worth your time.
