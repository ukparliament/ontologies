# 2025 - Week 18

## Librarian of the Week

Week 17 saw our much coveted Librarian of the Week trophy once more adorning the mantlepiece of a non-librarian. It will surprise almost no one to learn that our Jianhan was the non-librarian in question. If you've been following along from home, you'll be well aware that our major plot line of late has followed Jianhan's attempts to upgrade our aged triplestore. [Last time out](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2025/15/), we reported that his efforts had been signed off by our crack team of librarians and pushed live.

Like any proud new parent, Jianhan poured himself a cuppa and sat back to bathe in the applause. And like any proud new parent, quickly found himself awake all night as his beloved charge bowed to inevitable teething troubles. Ably supported by Librarians Deanne and Ned, large quantities of Calpol were applied before Jianhan took out his computational pliers to perform an extraction or two. We're pleased to report that our teething troubles are now a thing of the past and Jianhan is getting - almost - a full night's sleep. And much better he looks for it too.

The upgrade happened - as our major upgrades usually do - during recess. Or, more correctly, recesses, the two Houses ploughing their own furrows on such matters. The following week, our Members boarded the Hogwart's Express bound for Westminster, the inevitable deluge of digital data following in their wake. The first day of term has always been particularly busy for our crack team of librarians, floodgates opening as upwards of a thousand written questions submitted during recess get their 'tabled' button pressed. "All hands on deck," [Librarian Anya](https://bsky.app/profile/anyaso.bsky.social) has been heard to shout, anywhere up to 15 librarians putting in a nine hour shift. The more librarians joined the fray, the slower the software got. But not this time.

Dear reader, all of Jianhan's efforts worked. Not only did they work, they worked damned quickly. "It goes like sh*t of a sh*v*l," Librarian Ned was heard to report. Not words one usually associates with Ned. We do worry he might be spending too much time with [Michael](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasticlife.bsky.social). Despite a slight coarsening of language, Ned was not wrong. All tabled questions were subject indexed before the afternoon tea trolley arrived. Remarkable.

Not only this, the upgraded triplestore now comes with a copy of [Workbench](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.3/workbench.html) layered over the top of its [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) endpont. Which means, for the first time, our crack team of librarians can get their eyeballs on the data they're tasked with managing, tidying tickets almost inevitably following. It is a managerial cliche to meet efficiency gains with, "this is not taking away your jobs, this is freeing you up to be more creative." Only to walk into an empty office a couple of weeks later. But cliches are only cliches because they're occasionally true. Librarian time spent waiting for the blasted computers to save things, can now be spent tending our data infrastructure. Now all they need are the tools to fix the data without having to telephone the [Parliamentary Computational Section](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/parliamentary-digital-service/). A development we hope to plan for soon.

Well done Jianhan. We've rarely seen our librarians looking quite so happy.

## I am a procedural cartographer - to [the tune of the Palace Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owvF3Vb0JhA&ab_channel=tomkat69pc)

With the triplestore upgrade out of the way and Librarian Jayne back on duty, Jianhan has also found time to attend to a bug or two in the pipes between our [procedure editor database](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/procedure/meta/editor/schema.svg) and yet another of our triplestores.

A [step](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e242) we dearly wished to delete in procedure editor [stubbornly refused to comply with our demands](https://trello.com/c/cdOkfqs1/494-step-to-be-deleted), whilst a handful of [business items created in procedure editor had failed to show up in the triplestore](https://trello.com/c/5RuW309v/493-business-items-not-pulling-through-to-triplestore). Eventual consistency, they said. Such is computational life. Anyway, they are both now fixed. More thanks Jianhan.

Also fixed is a small bug whereby [business items describing laying in the House of Lords were not being populated](https://trello.com/c/w0Vq02ZY/502-procedure-editor-solr-feed-lords-layings) for bicameral instruments. Or at least not for bicameral statutory instruments, treaties being oddly unaffected. It turned out the ordering of identifiers was important here. As the ordering of identifiers so often is.

If our dear reader tuned in last time out, they'll know that [Librarian Ayesha](https://bsky.app/profile/askalibrarylady.bsky.social) and her computational helpmate Michael got themselves in a proper tizzy over the [legislative conjugation of 'laying' and 'statement'](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/section/21#section-21-2). Not words a parliamentary pedant expects to find in the same sentence. Or at least not these parliamentary pedants.

It turned out we'd failed to properly read the legislation and, as a result, placed the emphasis on the word statement, skipping quite past the word laying. Confusion was compounded by the presence of an additional *made* ministerial statement for the [Agreement, done at London on 14 June 2023, between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Swiss Confederation on Recognition of Professional Qualifications](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packages/VtVa9Znp#date-2023-09-04), whilst the [One Hundred Year Partnership Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Ukraine](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packages/Dhk3Z2oN) saw no such effort made.

Our [treaty procedure map](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/treaties/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf) has now been updated to reflect our new understanding, steps being added for the laying of a statement in both the [Commons](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/steps/1O5qs3hp) and the [Lords](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/steps/PN8BA0EV). These new steps are accompanied by an optional step describing any subsequent *making* of a statement. Again in both the [Commons](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/steps/iOyniHBD) and the [Lords](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/steps/PLPZglkA). So that's cleared that up. Splendid.

Computational pipe cleaning and cartegraphic exploits all help pass the time, but would be for naught - or for nowt, as Michael might say - if eyeballs never met pixels. To that end, we've also been hard at work on our [Procedure Browsable Space](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser)&trade;, this week seeing the addition of a new page listing [work packages](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e193) containing [business items](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e182) [actualising](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e508) one or more [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e242) in a [step collection](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e450). Quite the mouthful. Or gobful, as Michael might say. Here, for instance, is [a list of work package where at least one committee has raised some form of concern](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/step-collections/7CBVQcZF/work-packages). For those who'd like an alert whenever a new work package joins this illustrious list, an [RSS feed is available](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/step-collections/7CBVQcZF/work-packages.rss). Because of course it is. Very handy as we're sure our reader would agree.

Also joining the done pile are pages [listing work packageable things](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packageable-things), pages [listing work packages for work packageable things](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packageable-things/fE3SIalj), pages for [preceding work packageable things](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packageable-things/dlDaHlvB/preceding), and pages for [following work packageable things](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/work-packageable-things/YzqmIaHq/following). At which point, our dear reader is most probably asking, "what in God's name is 'work packageable thing'? Have you gone quite mad?" Well, a work packageable thing is the focus of a parliamentary work package. It describes a set of things including bills, secondary legislation and treaties. Whilst bills and secondary legislation might both be described as legislation, treaties aren't. And whilst secondary legislation and treaties might both be described as instruments - or indeed papers - bills aren't. Let's not even get started on [FRBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records). So, for now, we're stuck with the rather horrible 'work packageable things'. If you have a better suggestion, we'd be eternally grateful. Answers on a postcard, please.

Over in websiteland, Computational Section colleagues have made a couple of welcome changes to our [treaty tracking website](https://treaties.parliament.uk/), finally bringing URLs for [work packageable things](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/uS20DBTy) and [work packages](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/uS20DBTy/timeline/Wgd3Ewfb/) - yes, those blasted words again - in line with our [statutory instrument website](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/). Consistency not being nothing. The same release also saw a dash of consistency applied to the display of business items actualising more than one step. As can be seen on [the timeline for the One Hundred Year Partnership Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Ukraine](https://treaties.parliament.uk/treaty/QLU0pOwt/timeline/Dhk3Z2oN), where 25 March saw the [International Agreements Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/448/international-agreements-committee/) publish [a report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldintagr/102/10202.htm) not only [drawing the treaty to the special attention of the House](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/procedures/D00dsjR2/steps/n3eNw1cK), but also [calling for a debate](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/procedures/D00dsjR2/steps/zkVd8rEg) on the matter. Splendid stuff.

## New, old search

In the continuing absense of a developer, work on new, old search has ground to a halt. Poor [Lydia](https://bsky.app/profile/lydiakeegal.bsky.social) continues to jump through recruitment process hoops, only to find more hoops spawning in their place. Like Sonic the Hedgehog, if Sonic the Hedgehog were somewhere between exasperated and baffled.

We do, however, have one thing to report. Both versions of our Poller code - the bit between the triplestore and Solr - now [make use of the external MNIS API, rather than the internal one that had been in use](https://trello.com/c/nyXu3LMn/213-fork-poller-to-use-external-mnis-api-rather-than-internal-in-lift-and-shift). We suspect that this actually happened months ago, but someone forgot to move the ticket. Included here then for completeness and as a reminder to self to keep moving the tickets. Else we'll never know what's done. And what isn't. Can someone create a ticket for that?

## Taxonomic liberation (or, toward a single subject view of the Library)

Efforts to liberate our taxonomy from software captivity continue. As our dear reader will well know, part of the plan involves 'indexing' Library researchers with taxonomic subjects describing their specialisms. This week Librarians Susannah, Phil and Silver have been cobbling together a spreadsheet aimed at capturing the inevitable deluge of feedback when researchers first set eyes on on the subjects they've been assigned.

The second part of the plan involves stretching the legs of our taxonomy's [transitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation). To understand this bit, you need to know that concepts in our taxonomy are tied together in a (poly)hierarchical fashion by broader than and narrower than relationships. So dogs are narrower than mammals, for example. Now, Parliamentary Search, the main consumer of the taxonomy, has never made use of those relationships, because the taxonomy is stored separately to the indexed material. But our Single Subject View of the Library&trade; application does. Which means our taxonomic structure needs tidying a little. This week, Team:Taxonomy have been focussing on organisations, which were a fairly flat list but now have a little more structure. As a starter for ten, we have [a new rule](https://trello.com/c/GWfafrwC/357-nt-or-rt-mostly-orgs) in place whereby organisation A is defined as narrower than another organisation B if A is a legal subsidiary of B as far as Companies House is concerned. Which feels like a nice solution.

## Psephologising wildly

Psephological efforts remained focussed on importing our [maiden speech publication](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04588/) to the [election results website](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/). A simple task in theory, made more difficult by many and varied mistmatches between constituency identifiers and labels across assorted systems and time periods. Which means we've been mainly decanting data between systems by means of a slightly leaky bucket.

This week, [Librarian Phil](https://bsky.app/profile/philbgorman.bsky.social) has been triple checking that the [1997 constituency names](https://trello.com/c/nT7TB2pm/447-second-pass-check-on-1997-constituency-names) stored in [MNIS](https://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/#) match the legislation that created them. Over in election results land, Michael has also been engaged in somewhat similar work to [align 2005/10 constituency names](https://trello.com/c/6rC4KTqT/540-fix-2005-10-constituency-names) with the legislation that created them. He's also stripped out a rather annoying "smart quote" that had somehow crept into [Regent's Park and Kensington North](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/constituency-areas/1772). Never let Microsoft get involved in your toolchain being one lesson learned. That, then, is names sorted out.

When the 1997 constituency data came through from [Statistician Carl](https://bsky.app/profile/carlbaker.bsky.social), it was accompanied by MNIS constituency identifiers. Damned handy, as it turned out, but not something that had been present in the spreadsheets covering the 2005/10 and 2024 constituencies. Now, given we'd previously been keying constituencies off [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) issued geographic codes and that such codes were never minted for the 1997 constituencies in [Northern Ireland](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/9) and [Scotland](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/boundary-sets/11), getting MNIS identifiers for all constituencies became something of a priority. For that reason, Librarian Phil provided a complete list, which Michael has now imported into psephologyland. Lovely stuff.

Back over in the maiden speech [PFF](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/parliament-facts-and-figures/), Librarian Anna has [added ONS issued geographic codes across all pertinent constituencies](https://trello.com/c/3zklXBsB/10-add-missing-geographic-codes-to-pff) from 1997 onwards, whilst [Librarian Emily](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyjdavi.bsky.social) has been busy [adding MNIS constituency identifiers to the same spreadsheet](https://trello.com/c/gLHVspim/4-populate-mnis-constituency-id-column-on-pff). Which means MNIS, election results and the PFF are finally in sync for both constituency names and constituency identifiers. Michael has, in turn, taken that spreadsheet and rewritten [the script to load maiden speeches](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/blob/main/lib/tasks/live/20-import-maiden-speeches/import_maiden_speeches.rake) into the election results database. Keen eyes will notice that that script only imports a maiden speech [if it can match on both the Member](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/blob/main/lib/tasks/live/20-import-maiden-speeches/import_maiden_speeches.rake#L28) and [the constituency the Member represented at the time the maiden speech was made](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/blob/main/lib/tasks/live/20-import-maiden-speeches/import_maiden_speeches.rake#L47). Given our constituency data only stretches back to 1997, maiden speeches made by Members prior to that will not yet be linked to. For which we can only apologise. Rest assured, matters will improve as our historical constituency data improves.

A few template changes later and links to maiden speeches now pop up on [Member pages](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/members/4514#maiden-speech), [constituency pages](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/constituency-areas/239/maiden-speeches) and [Parliament period pages](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/parliament-periods/58/maiden-speeches). One hell of a lot of underwater paddling for a small splash of hypertext. But that's librarian life.

The only other additions to the election results website, are [links from constituency pages to a couple of new Commons Library data dashboards](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/constituency-areas/1090#constituency-statistics): one describing [voting patterns across different demographics](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/census-data-how-do-constituencies-with-different-demographics-vote/?conSelect=%22Oldham%20East%20and%20Saddleworth%22), the other [sewage discharge data in England](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/constituency-data-sewage-discharges-in-england/?conSelect=%22Oldham%20East%20and%20Saddleworth%22).

## Facts and indeed figures

Still with our lovely little collection of Parliamentary Facts and Figures, this week also saw yet another publication emerge from the <abbr title="Indexing and Data Management Section">IDMS</abbr> paint shop, this one listing [living former Members of the House of Commons](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn05324/). If you're in the market for non-dead former Members with dates for first entry into the House, dates of departure and party affiliations at the point of departure, this is your one stop shop.

## Managing Members

It has been noted by our crack team of Member managers that whether a minister is paid or not lives as a bolean on a Member's incumbency in their ministerial position. Which means, should a minister flip from being unpaid to paid - or indeed vice versa - we need to close their existing incumbency and create a new one. All of which makes incumbency data harder to query, which is less than ideal. Without a change to the MNIS database, there's nothing we can really do to mitigate this. Computational Section colleagues have [been alerted](https://trello.com/c/kGTl5vR5/444-government-posts-moving-from-unpaid-to-paid).

In other late breaking, administrivia news, deep within the bowels of MNIS, there is a field storing our Members' preferred names. Whilst the rest of the Commons half of MNIS may be firmly under the control of our crack team of librarians, preferred names are something of an outlier. Should a Commons member be lucky enough to have an honour conferred upon them, the Journal Office are sure to be in touch to check if said Member wishes to include their honorific prefix in their preferred name. Some choose to include, some choose to not do. Which is fine. Unless you're offstage in a government department or a committee office and you're mistakenly attempting to integrate data with a spot of string matching. Over the past few months, both of these sets of stakeholders have been in touch to complain that their spreadsheets were failing to string match when they assume 'Sir' and our Members do not. Following careful consideration with the Commmons Journal Office, it's been decided to leave the current policy in place. After all, when you're attempting to integrate data and find yourself string matching, something has gone wrong. A string being no substitute for a  thing. As any fule know.
