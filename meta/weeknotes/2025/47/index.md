# 2025 - Week 47

Despite it being four weeks since we last got in touch, our Trello boards remain modestly silent on matters of progress. This mostly because complex plans go out the window when chaos strikes.

## More trouble int' data mill

At least in theory, our Jianhan was supposed to be concentrating all efforts on [upgrading our taxonomy software](https://trello.com/b/R7GDcGou/semaphore-56). At least that was the plan that was planned at our last planning session. Unfortunately, events intervened when our internal version of [data.parliament](https://explore.data.parliament.uk/) popped, banged and conked out. This would not have been such a big deal were it not a critical component in the publishing of briefings from our [three](https://post.parliament.uk/) [research](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/) [services](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/). It turns out that information flows from the authoring application to internal data.parliament to external data.parliament to the websites. Which meant researchers in all three services pressed publish and nothing got published. This happened to coincide with a couple of days of Commons Library contingency planning, so that at least was fortuitous. Nothing makes wargaming quite so much fun as getting shot at.

The outage lasted three days before Jianhan took matters into hand. Memory has been now been increased to the maximum possible. Which means, should that box pop or bang or conk out again, we have a much bigger problem. Jianhan continues to investigate, an upgrade to the antiquated triplestore looking not unlikely.

## Procedural publishing

Sticking with the subject of slightly archaic software, our procedure editor application is also getting a little long in the tooth, being untouched by developer hand for longer than might be considered ideal. And I think we all know [how software ages](https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/why-applications-are-like-fish-and-data-is-like-wine/). For those unfamiliar, procedure editor is the application used to manage both our [marvellous maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/) and the [business items](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e182) in [work packages](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e193) [actualising](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e508) [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e242) in said maps. Should it ever fall over, we'd be left with neither a [statutory instrument service](https://statutoryinstruments.parliament.uk/) nor a [treaty tracking service](https://treaties.parliament.uk/). Not to mention the all too early demise of our [Procedure Browsable Space](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser)&trade;.

For that reason, Librarian Jayne and her computational lapdog [Michael](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasticlife.bsky.social) have been hard at work investigating whether procedure editor could be replaced by an off the shelf solution. That solution going by the name of [Data Graphs](https://datagraphs.com/). Before any such decision can be made, testing needs to take place, and testing can only take place once there's some data loaded. Over the course of several dozen meetings, Jayne and Michael have been writing [a whole bunch of SQL to export relationally-shaped data](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/editor/data-graphs/instance-data/data-loading), in order to load it into its more graph-shaped proposed new home. [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) that will, in theory, make the whole process easy to replicate should the decision to move house be answered in the affirmative.

As of this week, they are pleased to report that all of the 'reference' side of the [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology) - so [procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e379), [routes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e352), [steps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e242), [step types](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e229), [step collections](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e450), [houses](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e439), and [legislatures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e427) - is now populated. Or everything that Michael's eyes believe to be green on [our data loading diagram](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/meta/editor/data-graphs/instance-data/data.svg). Just papers, work packages and business items to go, then. They did promise they'd have all the data fully loaded by Christmas, ready to test in the new year. At this point, that promise feels a little touch and go, but they might just make it.

Given our dear old procedure editor has not fallen over and died quite yet, librarian work continues. At some point earlier this year, the decision was taken that both our maps and data should include any and all reasons why the [Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/255/secondary-legislation-scrutiny-committee) might [draw the attention of the House to a statutory instrument](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser/steps/Kn7FknDd). Since adding these new steps, all work packages falling into this bucket have had one or more of them actualised. Which left something of a gap for instruments laid between late 2007 and early 2025. A gap that has now been plugged by Librarian Emma. Top work Emma.

In our final bit of Procedure Browsable Space&trade; news, that website is the latest to leave our [corporate colours paint shop](https://github.com/ukparliament/procedure-browser/pull/76), and [pretty impressive](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser) it looks too. Or at least Michael thinks it does. Librarian Jayne's testing ruler awaits deployment.

## Busy 'brarians

Whilst the computational side of things has been little short of calamity, our crack team of librarians have been cracking on regardless. At some point it was noticed that proceedings introducing or discussing [new clauses](https://trello.com/c/yGpanLNs/383-new-clauses) and / or [new schedules](https://trello.com/c/X9iA5swa/384-new-schedules) to bills had not been indexed as such. Breaking out her indexing pencil, Librarian Emma has now rectified that.

Librarian Emma has also been busy over in the world of the [Committee of Selection](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/381/committee-of-selection/) where [nine years of missing proceedings have now been added](https://trello.com/c/O30UdVks/348-committee-of-selection-committee-proceedings) together with three years worth of Speaker Statements confirming memberships.

Not content with that, Emma has been busy indexing [written statements issued as corrections](https://trello.com/c/OigopacL/206-ministerial-corrections-as-written-statements). This new-ish policy was put in place sometime around November 2024 and covers all such statements made since then. Always one for consistency, Emma has combed through 19 sessions worth of written statements, marking those issued as corrections appropriately.

Still with written statements, and still, remarkably, with Librarian Emma - how does she find the time? - she's also been adapting our data to reflect a new policy on [government statements made in response to Opposition Day resolutions](https://trello.com/c/wRFKoNAL/25-written-statements-in-response-to-opposition-day-resolutions). The new policy meaning such statements are no longer indexed as 'Opposition Days', but instead linked to the debate itself with a searcher note explaining that they are a “Government response to a Opposition Day debate”. Much neater.

Stage left, Librarian Martin has also been attending to government responses published as select committee reports and [adding corporate authors as appropriate](https://trello.com/c/mzvVU558/300-select-committee-reports-government-responses-corporate-authors). Perhaps more impressively, he's also gone back over [31 sessions worth of points of order made during points of order proceedings and deemed to be actual points of order by the Speaker](https://trello.com/c/mql2J6W3/370-points-of-order), indexing all such contributions as points of order. As one might expect.

Finally, [Librarian Anya](https://bsky.app/profile/anyaso.bsky.social) stumbled across a handful of General Committee proceedings which had accidentally found themselves with a committee in the department field. Librarian Martin has [also now fixed that](https://trello.com/c/fL2K81Lh/340-general-committee-proceedings-with-a-committee-in-the-department-field).

## Taxonomic tinkerings

Further back, in the backend of indexing, changes have also been happening in our taxonomy of terms. In the first place, a number of names which had been used by our crack team of indexers but never controlled as concepts, have been checked, doubled checked and [turned into controlled concepts as appropriate](https://trello.com/c/ErctUdh9/80-uncontrolled-names). Any affected indexings also being updated. Fine work from Librarians Ned and Phil.

In the second place, team:taxonomy have also been pondering the preponderance of Member identifiers being present in the taxonomy, picked up by the <abbr title="Ontology Refresh Service">ORefIS</abbr> service and inserted into the Search and Indexing triplestore. For reasons that should be obvious, [some taxonomic terms are in use for more than one Member](https://trello.com/c/MBLRREbI/379-orefis-fix-inc0210788-reducing-the-number-of-note-fields). This being true for both bishops and hereditary peers. In such cases, our taxonomy might carry up to four MNIS IDs on one concept. The next Bishop of Durham bringing that up to a round five. Following investigations by our Jianhan, it turns out that ORefIS only wrote the value in the first MNIS field. Should it find a different value in this field, the old code would delete from the triplestore and replace with the new value. Jianhan has now adapted this code to make the process additive, rather than a like-for-like replacement. Thanks Jianhan.

## Psephologising wildly

Behind the scenes, a fair bit of work has been happening on our [psephological efforts](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/), all in preparation for the next general election. [Last time out](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/6) we only published when all the results in all the constituencies had been verified by our crack team of researchers. The next time out, we're aiming for a four state solution:

* Placeholder pages for every election in every constituency, with some kind of 'coming soon' message to appear at dissolution.

* The same pages, additionally listing candidates, once nominations close and all the candidates are gathered.

* The same pages listing winners as soon as possible following the election.

* All the vote numbers for all the candidates in all the elections in all the constituencies once all those numbers have been verified. At this point, the many and varied aggregations will also be made available.

To that end - ably assisted by Data Analyst Rachel - Michael has been [modifying the psephology code](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/pull/102) and [generating four different databases](https://github.com/ukparliament/psephology/pull/102/files#diff-e650351f668b1cae649c1b985105f2f4ff2e3cdb9ddf89331a9349d0ca2ebab1) to reflect the four different states. These efforts are currently with [Statistician Carl](https://bsky.app/profile/carlbaker.bsky.social) for final signoff.

With an optimistic hat on, we're half aiming for a 4.5 state solution, whereby the full results for a given election in a given constituency are published as soon as those particular results are verified. Though between now and then, we need to replace the application used to gather election results. Whether or not the part verified state might be possible, depends on how well that goes.

## Managing Members

Whilst managing the data describing current Members is quite hard, doing that in real time in response to breaking news is harder still. There are some events - be that defections, deaths, resignations or removals - that we really can't afford to miss. Given team:[Phil](https://bsky.app/profile/philbgorman.bsky.social) is one whole librarian down at the moment, he's taken the time to set up a suite of [Factiva](https://www.dowjones.com/business-intelligence/factiva/) alerts, in the hope we'll never be caught on the hop again.

## Bots to Bluesky (and beyond)

Last time out, we reported that our new [tweaty twacking](https://procedure-bots-4f425a627a21.herokuapp.com/tweaty-twacker) code was considered complete, only waiting for the government to lay a treaty for final testing. Since then, not one, not two, not three, but five treaties have been laid. All finding their way unimpeded to both [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/tweaty-twacker.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.me.uk/@TweatyTwacker). Jianhan's old code is now switched off, Michael's code having taken over the task.
