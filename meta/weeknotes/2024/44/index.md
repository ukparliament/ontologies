# 2024 - Week 43

As the clocks slip back and the nights lengthen, everything is running a little backwards. Both in terms of week and notes. For once we start at the end, with an update on our outreach and engagement strategy.

## Outreach and engagement

Office life kicked off on a Monday, which is unusual for us. This because Developer Jon did not make good his threat of "[dying of death](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2024/43/#new-old-search)", deciding a holiday would be more appropriate. Quite surprisingly, for a semi-Northern lad, choosing [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnticlldMm4) as his destination. Which is how Librarians [Anya](https://bsky.app/profile/anyaso.bsky.social) and Jayne, Delivery Manager Lydia and computational bag carrier [Michael](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasticlife.bsky.social) found themselves in Portcullis House 'bright' and early on a Monday morning waiting for Jon and his friend Lily to clear security. Bags checked, they embarked on a whistlestop tour of what some people call our 'palace'. Front of house was ticked off, backstage was explored, two gift shops were visited, [parliamentary socks](https://www.shop.parliament.uk/search?q=socks) were purchased. Lovely to finally meet you Jon. And lovely to meet you, Lily. Do come back soon.

Monday was not our last trip across Westminster, Thursday marking the inaugural outing of the Parliamentary Pudding Club. It is our intention to pay a monthly visit to one of Parliament's very many steamed pudding purveyors and sample both their sponge and their custard. The very first Pudding Club outing saw a trip to Bellamy's where Librarians Anya, Ayesha, Emily, Jayne, Jason, [Phil](https://bsky.app/profile/philbgorman.bsky.social) and Steve, Data Analyst Rachel and Keeper of the Pudding Spoon Michael, went face down in [a very acceptable coconut and jam pudding](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:yvkm6wii3ylznd2heapad54l/post/3l7suwobhlu25). Whilst the temptation to create a pudding rating spreadsheet was clearly strong, Pudding Club offers the opportunity to step outside of the daily drudgery. We didn't think another information management task should come between us and our puddings.

Fresh off her [groundbreaking tour of the Highlands and Islands](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2024/43/#outreach-and-engagment) - well, Edinburgh, let's not get carried away - Librarian Susannah has announced she's secured an agent, a manager and a recording contract, and is shortly to embark on her debut tour of Europe. Well, Brussels. Let's not get carried away. All this off the back of her debut single, "How to plan for a general election and then not panic when one happens". Godspeed, Librarian Susannah. Have a criminally strong beer on us.

## Vacation update

Before pressing on, we should make our excuses. Not only did Developer Jon choose to head off on a seasonal city break, our Jianhan and Silver also chose November - of all months - for rest and recuperation. Now we are by no means 'tech bros'. To the best of our knowledge, we've never asked a single person 'do you even code, bro?'. But a sudden loss of developers makes development somewhat hard. Please don't blame us for the lack of visible progress. We've been paddling like ducks under the surface.

## On matters concerning legislation, legislatures and consent

If you tuned in [last time out](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2024/43/), you'll know Librarian Jayne has roped in computational cabin lads [Young Robert](https://bsky.app/profile/robertbrook.bsky.social) and Michael to cobble together some [procedure tracking clickable pixels](https://procedure-browser-159b715822a4.herokuapp.com/). Their intention had been to start with the nuts and bolts of [procedural model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology) infrastructure - [routes](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e328), [clocks](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e341), [calculation styles](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e368) and etc. Or the boring stuff, if you will. That changed on Wednesday morning when Jayne and Michael met [Graeme](https://bsky.app/profile/woodstockjag.bsky.social) for a reprise of earlier [legislative consent motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_consent_motion) chats.

Given we recently got a couple of days of our Jianhan's time -  thanks Lydia - we believe we have everything in place to enter and store LCM data, with just enough about bills to contextualise what consent is being given to. Or not, as the case may be. The remaining problems are twofold: knowing what is actually happening in the devolved legislatures and serialising what gets captured into a reasonable set of pixels. Devolving access to our procedure editor application might be one way to solve the first problem. Providing a linked spreadsheet that's procedure editor shaped might be another. Both are under active consideration.

Providing access to pixels has been made much easier by our [procedure browser application](https://github.com/ukparliament/procedure-browser), but that's not going to help if it's only serialising the boring stuff. For that reason, Jayne and Michael have taken a spanner to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Rmdpcsmx/procedure-browseable-space); routes, clocks and calculation styles moving left; work packages - and their timelines - moving right. Goodbye, for now, boring stuff.

Elsewhere, though still in procedure land, efforts continue to translate our [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology) into something [Data Graphs](https://datalanguage.com/products/datagraphs) is happy to swallow. This week, our beloved procedure model gained a new class of [Procedure Collection](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology#d4e377), better to group remedial orders of the [made](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/remedial-orders/made-affirmative/made-affirmative.pdf) and [draft](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/maps/legislation/secondary/statutory-instruments/super-affirmative-procedures/remedial-orders/draft-affirmative/draft-affirmative.pdf) affirmative varieties. Those comments still need work.

## New, old search

With Developer Jon off exploring the sights and sounds of London town, visible progress on our [new, old search application](https://search-prototype.herokuapp.com/search-prototype) has been minimal. That said, we do have some good news. Again thanks to the wonder working of Delivery Manager Lydia, we've managed to get our hands on Data Analyst Rachel for a wee while. Rachel was last seen diving head first into the Harvester code - binders full of C# that hasn't been touched by human hand in the last 13 years. The Harvester code is what takes [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)) - yes, it really is that old - feeds from upstream procedural systems, applies a layer of business logic and pipes the results to the [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore). The 'business logic' bit in the middle being something of a black box. We remain hopeful that if Rachel peers at it for long enough, she might be able to open that black box and reveal what's inside. Runes, perhaps.

## Managing members

Amongst their many other duties, our crack team of librarians take on much of the management of member information in the [Members' Names Information System](https://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/). Or at least the Commons half of it. That work suffered something of a hiccup when the unexpectedly early general election caused an all hands on deck moment. That Librarians Anna and Emily were also dragged sideways to tidy and improve the data for our [election results website](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/) didn't help matters.

Finally on the far side of the general election, we found ourselves in the unenviable position of running two MNIS-themed Trello boards: one supposedly general election focussed but failing to stick to that remit, one, in theory, more general. Boss 'brarian Anya placed her foot down with a firm hand, declaring there shall be but a single board. Minds turned to how we might combine them.

Luckily, before doing that, we'd managed to find the time to sit down with the [MNIS database schema](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/meta/relational/mnis/schema.svg) and highlight which bits concern us and which of those bits we consider tidy. The schema picture provided all the grouping clues we needed, the big bubbles now turned into what Young Robert might call 'epics', the 'epics' all added as columns to our [new, clean Trello board](https://trello.com/b/TkNLlmo7/mnis-decant). All cards from the two old boards have been decanted across and placed in the correct buckets. The old boards are now closed. Tidy!

Our new annotated MNIS schema picture can be found as a [PDF](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/meta/relational/mnis/idms-concerns/schema.pdf) or an [SVG](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/meta/relational/mnis/idms-concerns/schema.svg) in everyone's favourite GitHub repo. Why not print one out and pin it to your bedroom wall? Should your bedroom wall be large enough.

## On indexing and the reviewing of indexing

Two pieces of late breaking news over in indexing land, the first concerning a mammoth effort to check roughly 1,500 draft statutory instruments laid prior to the 57th Parliament. Or 2017 in old money. Some going back as far as 1984. All [1,500 have been checked](https://trello.com/c/IQuDjxRW/313-old-draft-sis-that-need-updating-have-they-been-made), around 880 being found to have departed Parliament and subsequently been made. The 880 have gained a made date and a reclassification, links to pertinent proceedings also being added. Top work from Librarian Emma there.

Work over in new, old search-land turned up 22 records having no assigned type. Most appeared to be ministerial corrections but checking was required. So check Librarian Jayne did. Checking complete, a call went in to colleagues in the [Computational Section](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/parliamentary-digital-service/) and [that call has now been answered](https://trello.com/c/DFBsYI1e/342-records-without-type), all 22 records finding new homes on correct shelves.

## Farewell - for now? - Mastodon

Our regular reader will be well aware of the time and effort Librarian Anna - in particular - has put into our [army of Mastodon and Bluesky bot accounts](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/bots/). Imagine then our disappointment when [Shedcode](https://shedcode.co.uk/) [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies) got in touch to pass on the message that [botsinspace](https://botsin.space/about) - our chosen provider for Mastodon bottery - had [announced its imminent closure](https://muffinlabs.com/posts/2024/10/29/10-29-rip-botsin-space/). Or sunsetting, as Young Robert might say. Brilliant. Just brilliant.

If you're a Mastodon user and a follower of any of our bot accounts, it's perfectly possible they'll stop working shortly before Christmas. Alternative options are being explored, [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@Floppy) - different James - kindly suggested he [wouldn't be averse to hosting](https://mastodon.me.uk/@Floppy/113396233401412482). James - the first James - very kindly offered to [up his donations](https://mastodon.me.uk/@jamesjefferies/113396734234987019) to James - the second James - to help out. That said, both James - the different one - and [James](https://mastodon.me.uk/@james@bne.social) - another different one -  suggested that [Parliament hosting from its own domain would probably be for the best](https://mastodon.me.uk/@james@bne.social/113396276541231938). If [boss boss 'brarian Bryn](https://bsky.app/profile/brynmrgn.com) happens to be reading this, be aware this is us pulling our best puppy dog faces. How can anyone ignore that many Jameseses?
