          <h3>Class <a href="#AnswerExpectedAsChange">Answer expected as change</a></h3>

          <p>In the House of Commons, the change from an expectation of an oral answer to an expectation of a written answer. The change of expectation may be because the Member tabling the question is unable to attend the Chamber at the time the question was due to be answered, or because a question may be due in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. In the case of a Member not being present, they may either withdraw or unstar the question. Unstarring removes the question from the Order Paper and changes the form of the answer expected to written. When a question is not reached, the question is given a written answer unless the Member withdraws the question. In the House of Lords, a different Member attends the Chamber and asks the question on the tabling Member&#39;s behalf when the tabling Member cannot attend. There is no requirement for unstarring. In the House of Lords, questions tabled in expectation of an oral answer are always reached. There is no requirement for handling questions not reached.</p>

In the House of Commons, a question tabled in expectation of an oral answer may change to a question in expectation of a written answer - and would have two Answer Expected As relationships: one for the first period when the form of answer expected is oral and one for the second period when the form of answer expected is written.</p>

In the House of Lords, the Table Office assigns written and private notice questions to an answering body. For questions in expectation of an oral answer, no assignment takes place.</p>

They are usually asked of a Minister in a Government department, though questions can be asked of Members representing non-departmental bodies, for example: Church Commissioners. Parliamentary questions can be asked in expectation of either a written or an oral answer, spoken by a Member in the Chamber. Parliamentary questions are tabled in the Table Office of the Lords or the Commons.</p>

In the House of Lords such questions are referred to as private notice questions. Urgent questions and private notice questions are applied for to the Speaker or the Lord Speaker rather than being tabled in the Table Office: the text of an urgent question or a private notice question does not appear on the Order Paper. A debate in the Chamber takes place if an application is granted.</p>

Answers are provided by a person incumbent in a position in government or in a non-departmental answering body with a duty to answer parliamentary questions. For questions in receipt of an oral answer in the House of Lords, this may be the incumbency held by a person in a position as a government whip. [February 2022] Data for questions and answers identifies the Member providing the answer, but not the incumbency in a position with a duty to provide an answer. For this reason, we may need to fall back on pointing to a House seat incumbency.</p>
