This model only deals with questions that have been successfully tabled or raised as urgent, private notice or business questions in either House. Note that the handling of questions as calendar business events, any ministerial statements acting as corrections to answers and tabling events will be dealt with elsewhere.</section>

                <p>A time-bound means of defining the form of answer (oral or written) expected for a question. Sometimes a question in pursuit of an oral answer will be scheduled to be asked in the Chamber, but the Member intending to ask the question will be unable to attend the Chamber at that time. At this point the Member may either withdraw the question or unstar it (remove it from the schedule), meaning the question will receive a written answer. Sometimes a question may be scheduled in the Chamber but may not be reached because the allocated time runs out. Unless the Member subsequently indicates that they wish to withdraw the question, a written answer will be given. In either scenario, such questions would have two Answer Expected As relationships: one for the initial period when the form of answer expected is oral and one for the second period when the form of answer expected is written. Note that the rules regarding unstarred and unreached questions only apply in the House of Commons. In oral question time in the House of Lords, a Member may ask a question on behalf of another Member.</p>

In the House of Commons this may be a government department but sometimes other bodies either Parliamentary or external to Parliament e.g. House of Commons Commission, Church Commissioners.

For written and private notice questions in the House of Lords, data exists to map questions to specific answering bodies; for oral questions it doesn&#39;t.</p>

                <p>Parliamentary questions (often referred to as PQs) allow Members to seek information from an answering body or to press a Secretary of State to take a particular action. Usually this is to a Minister in a government department but sometimes questions can be asked of non-departmental bodies. e.g. Church Commissioners. Parliamentary questions can be asked in expectation of either a written or an oral answer (one spoken by a Member in the Chamber). Unlike urgent and private notice questions, which are applied for to the Speaker or Lord Speaker privately, parliamentary questions are tabled with the Lords or Commons Table Offices.</p>

                <p>The round robin class provides a way to group two or more very similar questions asked of multiple answering bodies by a single Member. Sometimes round robins are used as a way for a Member to intentionally ask the same question of multiple answering bodies. Occasionally they&#39;re used where departmental responsibility for a given policy area is not clearly defined. Note that the definition of a round robin is fuzzy; the question text might vary slightly. Identifying round robins is a judgement call.</p>

                <p>Urgent questions allow Members of the House of Commons to ask a Minister about matters of an urgent character and relating to matters of public importance. In the House of Lords, such questions are referred to as private notice questions. Unlike parliamentary questions, the text of an urgent question or a private notice question does not appear on the schedule; it will be read in the Chamber. The answer will also always be oral. Urgent questions and private notice questions are not tabled with the Lords or Commons Table Offices; they are applied for to the Speaker or the Lord Speaker privately.</p>

                <p>Allows a question to be assigned to an answering body. In theory, allocation allows a single question to be assigned to multiple answering bodies. Note that this would be a major change from existing practice where the same question, when asked of different answering bodies, is considered to be a set of different questions. A question intended for multiple answering bodies is sometimes referred to as a round robin question. Because round robins are loosely defined and because the question text might vary slightly (e.g. when referring to the gender of the answering member), treating a round robin as a single question is not yet possible.</p>

                <p>Allows an answer to be associated with one or more questions. This replicates more precisely the current functionality around grouped questions. In other words, a group of questions tabled by a single Member in receipt of the same answer. There is some debate as to whether the same text given in answer to questions from multiple Members can be considered one, or the same, answer. This also allows a single question to have many answers. Sometimes there will be multiple answers from a single answering body at different points in time (holding answer, substantive answer, corrected substantive answer). Sometimes different answers from different answering bodies to the same question e.g. answers to a round robin question. Note that this is a major change to current data models, where a single question can have one and only one answer, and a single answer can be to one and only one question.</p>

Note that named day questions can only be tabled in the House of Commons. Most written questions are ordinary and the value here is false. By convention a Member can expect such questions to be answered within 7 days of tabling. Named day questions are used to elicit a faster response.</p>

                <p>Determines if a question is substantive. If true the question text will be meaningful and constitute the actual question that the Member wished to ask. If false the question text will be boilerplate text asking about a government department or the Prime Minister&#39;s appointments (respectively topical questions and Prime Minister&#39;s questions in the House of Commons). This will be answered in the Chamber, after which the asking Member will ask a supplementary question. This is a device to enable Members to ask supplementary questions on any topical subject without notice. It only applies to parliamentary questions expecting an oral answer and only applies in the House of Commons. The process for topical questions in the House of Lords differs slightly from that in the House of Commons, in that all questions tabled are substantive. Here topical refers to the shorter notice period allowed when tabling a question.</p>
