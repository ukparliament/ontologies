          <p>The type of disqualification of a disqualified Member, for example: in the House of Commons, on the grounds of being a Peer or Lord Spiritual in the House of Lords, or being convicted of treason under the Forfeiture Act 1870 - in the House of Lords, on the grounds of holding judicial office, being a Member of the European Parliament, or being bankrupt.</p>

          <p>A reason for the ending of a seat incumbency, or of a House seat. The incumbency of a Member may end following an election loss, by standing down, on retirement, on death - or due to changes in the makeup of a House, for example: the expulsion of hereditary peers following the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. Two hereditary seats remain after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. In the House of Lords, hereditary peerage seats ended with the extinction of the associated peerages. In the House of Commons, a seat may end by means of a constituency boundary change.</p>

        <article class="class" id="ParliamentPeriod">
          <h3>Class <a href="#ParliamentPeriod">Parliament period</a></h3>

          <p>The time period of a single Parliament between the date of its first assembly after a general election and its dissolution. A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods. During a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in force, the date of dissolution was determined by that Act or was named in a proclamation following a vote in Parliament for an early general election. The next Parliament began on the date named in the proclamation issued following a dissolution. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 came into force and after that Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the date of dissolution is fixed by proclamation. The dissolution proclamation also names the date for Parliament to reassemble. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801.</p>
