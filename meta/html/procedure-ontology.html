      <h1>Procedure ontology</h1>

      <p id="description">A general purpose process flow model used to describe parliamentary procedure as a set of steps connected by routes. A step is a waypoint in a process, a route is a direction between steps and a procedure is analogous to a map of all possible routes. The model also describes the package of work in Parliament resulting from a bill or an instrument subject to a procedure.</p>

        <article class="class" id="Actualisation">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Actualisation">Actualisation</a></h3>

          <p>An actualisation, being the act of relating a business item to a procedural step.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="BusinessItem">
          <h3>Class <a href="#BusinessItem">Business item</a></h3>

          <p>An item of business conducted either within or outside Parliament. For example: a second reading debate, the tabling of an early day motion, a laying of a paper, the making of a statutory instrument by a government minister.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="CalculationStyle">
          <h3>Class <a href="#CalculationStyle">Calculation style</a></h3>

          <p>A calculation style is used to record the form of a calculation based on the sitting days counted by a clock, for example: either House being sitting or adjourned for less than four days, both Houses sitting or being adjourned for less than four days, or the House of Commons sitting or being adjourned for less than four days. A calculation style may set out the definition of the first day to be counted.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="Clock">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Clock">Clock</a></h3>

          <p>A clock sets out a number of days to be counted between a start step and an end step in a procedure. Within a work package, a clock is used to record the period of time between the date of the business item actualising a start step and the date of the business item actualising an end step. The start date of a clock is the date of the business item which actualises the start step of that clock. The end date of a clock is the date of the business item which actualises the end step of that clock. In a work package, the period of time resulting from a clock is dependent on the start date of the clock, the day count of the clock and the calculation style. Calculation styles are dependent on sitting days in one or both Houses. End dates of clocks in work packages currently before Parliament may change if sitting days change.</p>

        <article class="class" id="House">
          <h3>Class <a href="#House">House</a></h3>

          <p>A parliamentary House, for example: the House of Lords.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="Legislature">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Legislature">Legislature</a></h3>

          <p>A legislature, being either the UK Parliament or a devolved legislature.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="Procedure">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Procedure">Procedure</a></h3>

          <p>A procedure in a House or Houses. For example, the passage of a made affirmative statutory instrument in both Houses. A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure. Procedures may be constructed from commonly occurring sets of routes. For example, the set of routes involved in EVEL certification.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="Route">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Route">Route</a></h3>

          <p>A route is a link from one step to another. The source of a route may also be its destination. A route is available when the from step is True, actualised by a business item having a date in the past, or by the input from a logic gate step being True. The validity period of a route may be indicated by its start or end date. A route linking a business step actualised by a business item with a date in the past to a business step which has not been actualised indicates that actualisation of the step will happen in the future, being a causal relationship.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="RouteAvailability">
          <h3>Class <a href="#RouteAvailability">Route availability</a></h3>

          <p>The availability of a route over time. A route may be open or closed. A route may reopen after being closed. The availability of a route may change as a result of a change to legislation, for example: routes in the procedure for proposed negative statutory instruments laid under Section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will only remain open- as set out under the Act - until two years after completion day. The availability of a route may change as a result of a standing order being introduced, suspended or rescinded, for example: the standing orders setting out rules for English Votes for English Laws were first suspended, then rescinded. The availability of a route may change as a result of an order of a House in Parliament, for example: a formal proceeding may establish a new committee, creating a new route to a step for consideration by that committee.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="RouteAvailabilityStatus">
          <h3>Class <a href="#RouteAvailabilityStatus">Route availability status</a></h3>

          <p>The status of a route&#39;s availability, being either open or closed.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="Step">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Step">Step</a></h3>

          <p>A step is either a business step, a logic gate step or a decision step. Steps are joined by routes to form procedures. For example, within the SI procedures there exists a step named &#39;English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) consideration&#39;. Steps may occur in more than one procedure. For example, all statutory instrument procedures include the EVEL consideration step.</p>
         </article>
        <article class="class" id="StepCollection">
          <h3>Class <a href="#StepCollection">Step collection</a></h3>

          <p>A collection of steps. Step collections are used to collect steps of one type, for example: starting steps, concluding steps, website display steps, bill stage steps, or Member action steps. A step collection named &#39;Starting steps&#39; collects steps which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be started. A procedure may have one or more starting steps. A step collection named &#39;Concluding steps&#39; collects steps which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be concluded. A procedure may have one or more concluding steps. A step collection named &#39;Website visible steps&#39; collects steps which are intended to be visible on a website work package page once actualised by a business item in that work package. A procedure may have one or more steps described as website visible. A step collection named &#39;Second reading&#39;, within the House of Commons, collects steps forming that stage in that House. A step collection named &#39;Member action steps&#39; collects steps which are considered to be steps at which a Member is able to take an action. A procedure may have one or more steps considered to be Member action steps.</p>

        <article class="class" id="StepDisplayDepthInProcedure">
          <h3>Class <a href="#StepDisplayDepthInProcedure">Step display depth in procedure</a></h3>

          <p>The display depth of a business step in a procedure. There are occasions on which two business items actualising two different steps happen in the same work package on the same day: this class determines the display depth of those two business items. Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it is not possible to order business items in a way that makes &#39;procedural sense&#39;, for example: we may show &#39;procedure concluded&#39; before an instrument has been approved. Step display depth exists in order to allow a number to be associated with a step in a procedure allowing us to order by the date of the business item, then by the display depth of the step in the procedure. Display depth in this context is not absolute across the procedure. A step with depth 8 may happen before a step with depth 7. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening.</p>

        <article class="class" id="StepType">
          <h3>Class <a href="#StepType">Step type</a></h3>

          <p>A step has one type. The type of a step is a business step, decision step, logical NOT step, logical AND step, logical OR step, arithmetic SUM step, arithmetic INCREMENT step, arithmetic EQUALS step, or summation step.</p>

          <p>Used to record whether the clocks in the procedure a work package is subject to are frozen. A work package marked as frozen will not have the dates of business items actualising clock end steps automatically updated when sitting days change.
