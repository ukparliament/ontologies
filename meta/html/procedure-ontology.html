      <h1>Procedure ontology</h1>

      <p id="description">A general purpose process flow model used to describe parliamentary procedure as a set of steps connected by routes. A step is a waypoint in a process, a route is a direction between steps and a procedure is analogous to a map of all possible routes. The model also describes the package of work in Parliament resulting from a bill or an instrument subject to a procedure.</p>

          <h3>Class <a href="#Availability">Availability</a></h3>

          <p>The availability of a path or procedure over time. A route may reopen after being closed. The availability of a route may change as a result of a change to legislation, for example: routes in the procedure for proposed negative statutory instruments laid under Section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will only remain open- as set out under the Act - until two years after completion day. The availability of a route may change as a result of a standing order being introduced, suspended or rescinded, for example: the standing orders setting out rules for English Votes for English Laws were first suspended, then rescinded. The availability of a route may change as a result of an order of a House in Parliament, for example: a formal proceeding may establish a new committee, creating a new route to a step for consideration by that committee.</p>

          <h3>Class <a href="#Clock">Clock</a></h3>

          <p>A clock sets out a number of days to be counted between a start step and an end step in a procedure. Within a work package, a clock is used to record the period of time between the date of the event actualising a start step and the date of the event actualising an end step. The start date of a clock is the date of the event which actualises the start step of that clock. The end date of a clock is the date of the event which actualises the end step of that clock. In a work package, the period of time resulting from a clock is dependent on the start date of the clock, the day count of the clock and the calculation style. Calculation styles are dependent on sitting days in one or both Houses. End dates of clocks in work packages currently before Parliament may change if sitting days change.</p>

A procedure may consist of business in a particular House, such as a division; business undertaken by both Houses jointly, such as a joint committee; processes applying to either House, such as a time period; and activities outside Parliament, such as the making of a statutory instrument. In this model a procedure that consists of business in both Houses is considered as a single procedure. Procedures may be constructed from commonly occurring sets of routes. For example, the set of routes involved in EVEL certification.</p>

For example, all statutory instrument procedures include the EVEL consideration step.</p>

          <p>A collection of steps. Step collections are used to collect steps of one type, for example: starting steps, concluding steps, website display steps, bill stage steps, or Member action steps. A step collection named &#39;Starting steps&#39; collects steps which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be started. A procedure may have one or more starting steps. A step collection named &#39;Concluding steps&#39; collects steps which, when actualised in a work package, denote that that work package is considered to be concluded. A procedure may have one or more concluding steps. A step collection named &#39;Website visible steps&#39; collects steps which are intended to be visible on a website work package page once actualised by a business item in that work package. A procedure may have one or more steps described as website visible. A step collection named &#39;Second reading&#39;, within the House of Commons, collects steps forming that stage in that House. A step collection named &#39;Member action steps&#39; collects steps which are considered to be steps at which a Member is able to take an action. A procedure may have one or more steps considered to be Member action steps.</p>

        <article class="class" id="StepDisplayDepthInProcedure">
          <h3>Class <a href="#StepDisplayDepthInProcedure">Step display depth in procedure</a></h3>

          <p>The display depth of a business step in a procedure. There are occasions on which two business items actualising two different steps happen in the same work package on the same day: this class determines the display depth of those two business items. Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it is not possible to order business items in a way that makes &#39;procedural sense&#39;, for example: we may show &#39;procedure concluded&#39; before an instrument has been approved. Step display depth exists in order to allow a number to be associated with a step in a procedure allowing us to order by the date of the business item, then by the display depth of the step in the procedure. Display depth in this context is not absolute across the procedure. A step with depth 8 may happen before a step with depth 7. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening.</p>
