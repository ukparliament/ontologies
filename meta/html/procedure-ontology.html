      <h1>Procedure ontology</h1>

      <p id="description">A process flow model used to describe parliamentary procedure as a set of steps connected by routes. A step is a waypoint in a process, a route is a direction between steps and a procedure is analogous to a map of all possible routes. The model also describes the package of work resulting from a bill or an instrument subject to a procedure.</p>

        <article class="class" id="Availability">
          <h3>Class <a href="#Availability">Availability</a></h3>

          <p>The availability of a path - being a route or a clock - or a procedure over time. Availability may change as a result of a change to legislation, for example: the procedure for proposed negative statutory instruments laid under Section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will remain available - as set out under the Act - until two years after completion day. The availability of a route may change as a result of a standing order being introduced, suspended or rescinded, for example: the standing orders setting out rules for English Votes for English Laws were first suspended, then rescinded. The availability of a route may change as a result of an order of a House in Parliament, for example: a formal proceeding may establish a new committee, creating a new route to a step for consideration by that committee. An available thing, having been made unavailable, may subsequently be made available.</p>

          <p>A clock sets out a number of days to be counted between a clock start step and a clock end step in a procedure. Within a work package, a clock is used to record the period of time between the date of the business item actualising a clock start step and the date of the business item actualising a clock end step. The period of time resulting from a clock is dependent on the start date of the clock, the day count of the clock and the calculation style. End dates of clocks in work packages before Parliament may change.</p>

          <h3>Class <a href="#StepDisplayDepthInProcedure">Step display depth in procedure</a></h3>

          <p>The display depth of a business step in a procedure. A business item or items may actualise two different business steps in the same work package on the same day. Because we capture dates rather than times of business items it was not possible to order business items in a way that made &#39;procedural sense&#39;, for example: we may have shown &#39;Procedure concluded&#39; before &#39;Instrument approved&#39;. This class records the display depth of a business step forming part of the procedure, associating a display depth number with each step. For example: the &#39;Instrument created&#39; business step in the draft affirmative procedure has a display depth of 1.0, whereas the &#39;Laid before the House of Commons&#39; business step in the same procedure has a display depth of 3.1. These numbers are used to order business items in a work package sharing the same date. The context of display depth is constrained to parts of a procedure map where procedure specifies that if X happens it must happen before Y but that Y may happen without X happening. A business step with depth 8.0 may happen before a business step with depth 7.0, if those two business steps are on different branches of the procedure map. A business step may have different step display depths in different procedures.</p>

           <p>Relates a business item to the business step or steps being actualised by that business item. A record of a business item forming part of a work package actualises the potential step described by the business step, procedurally indexing the business item with the concept embodied by the business step. For example: a business item recording the laying of a paper before the House of Commons as part of a work package actualises the business step &#39;Laid before the House of Commons&#39;, making that potential step actual. A business item may actualise one or more business steps, for example: the business step for the putting of a question and the business step for the outcome may be actualised by one business item. A business step may be actualised one or more times, or none.</p>
