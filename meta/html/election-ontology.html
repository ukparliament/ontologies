      <h1>Election ontology</h1>

      <p id="description">A model describing incumbencies resulting from general elections, by-elections for seats in the House of Commons, by-elections for excepted hereditary peers in the House of Lords and elections for positions including that of the Speaker of the House of Commons. The model describes the result of an election regardless of the process by which that election has been conducted, and covers election returns by the 'first past the post' system and those which follow other methods. Where applicable, the model is aligned with the Cabinet Office Election Result Data Standard.</p>

          <h3>Class <a href="#ParliamentPeriod">Parliament period</a></h3>

          <p>The time period of a single Parliament between the date of its first assembly after a general election and its dissolution. A Parliament period contains contiguous session and prorogation periods. During a parliament period Parliament is either in session or prorogued. The start date of a Parliament may be changed by subsequent proclamations. A Parliament ends at the next dissolution. While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in force, the date of dissolution was determined by that Act or was named in a proclamation following a vote in Parliament for an early general election. The next Parliament began on the date named in the proclamation issued following a dissolution. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 came into force and after that Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the date of dissolution is fixed by proclamation. The dissolution proclamation also names the date for Parliament to reassemble. Parliament periods are the same across both Houses. Parliaments are numbered ordinally from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom, sitting in 1801.</p>
